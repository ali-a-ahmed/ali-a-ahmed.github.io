        <p>Hello, my name is Ali Ahmed and I am a recent graduate from the Ohio State University. During my education, I completed several hands-on projects, including designing a fan capable of tracking a person's heat signature within a room, and using software such as Power World and MATLAB to conduct power systems simulations and analysis.</p>

        <p>I’ve taken courses on power electronics and used power system equipment during lab so I have experience with power system equipments and software. I've applied these engineering skills beyond the classroom as well, building audio equipment like high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filters for personal music projects at home.</p>

        <p>Now that I've recently graduated, I am eager to apply my electrical engineering education and problem-solving experience professionally. I'm particularly excited about roles aligning with my academic background, hands-on project experience, and my passion for creating practical engineering solutions.</p>
