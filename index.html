        <h1>Ali Ahmed</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website.
            I recently graduated from The Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
            Here, you can explore some of the projects I've worked on over the past year.
            I'm passionate about power system infrastructure and designing practical tools and electronics that I can use in my day-to-day life. 
            In the About Me section, you'll find more information about my background and experience.
            If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
