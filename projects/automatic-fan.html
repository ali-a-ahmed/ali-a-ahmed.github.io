          The Automatic Fan project addresses the inefficiency
          of traditional fans that blow air indiscriminately. By detecting hotspots with a thermal camera 
          and rotating automatically to aim cool air exactly where it’s needed, the system reduces wasted 
          energy and offers targeted comfort.

          I worked on this project with a team of other engineering students. I was responsible for the 
          brainstorming, the material procurements, modding the pan-tilt system, and programming the 
          different elements together. The project took a year to complete, and the budget was $500.00 USD.
          At the end, we successfully demonstrated that the fan was able to meet the requirements.

        <h2>Design &amp; Components</h2>
        <p>
          This solution was built around four main components: the fan, a motorized
          pan-tilt system, the MLX90640 thermal camera, and a Raspberry Pi. The fan used is 
          the Hybrid Whisper. We chose it for being lightweight and powered by an 18V battery for 
          portability. The Bescor MP-101 motorized tripod head provides the pan/tilt control. The MLX90640 
          IR camera detects heat gradients in a 32×24 pixel array and is compatible with a Raspberry Pi 4.
          Finally, the Raspberry Pi 4 processes data and controls the motorized mount, ensuring the fan 
          points at the hottest region in view.

        <h2>Build</h2>
        <p>
          The core of this project is the integration of the fan, motorized tripod, thermal camera, and
          power supply. Below is a more in-depth look at how each subsystem was assembled and
          how the software ties it all together.
        </p>

        <h3>Subsystem Assembly</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Fan Assembly:</strong><br>
          <figure class="centered-img-container">

          </figure>
          We began with an 18V portable fan chosen for its cordless design. Several non-essential parts 
          (like the base and certain covers) were removed to reduce weight. This reduced the overall 
          load on the pan-tilt system.
        </p>

              <figcaption>Bescor MP-101 tripod head.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          A Bescor MP-101 motorized tripod head provides horizontal (pan) and vertical (tilt)
          rotation. Normally controlled via a wired remote, it was modified so the Raspberry
          Pi’s GPIO pins could drive the same signals.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Thermal Camera Integration:</strong><br>
          <figure class="centered-img-container">
            <img 
              src="../images/Thermal Camera attached.PNG" 
              alt="Thermal Camera attached to the fan"

            <figcaption>The MLX90640 camera attached in a custom 3D-printed case.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          The MLX90640 IR camera is attached at the center of the fan. This camera connects 
          to the Raspberry Pi via SCL and SDA pins. We used a refresh rate of ~2 Hz, balancing 
          performance with the Pi’s resources. The camera captures a 32×24 temperature grid, and the 
          Pi interprets that data to find the highest-temperature “blob” in view.

          <strong>Power Supply Setup:</strong><br>
          <figure class="centered-img-container">
            <img

            <figcaption>The battery, step-down module, and power wiring enclosed for safety.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          We wanted everything powered from a single 18V battery, but the Pi requires 5V.
          A step-down (buck) converter was introduced to regulate from 18V down to 5V/3A.
        </p>

        <h3>Software Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          We wrote a Python script on the Raspberry Pi that:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Continuously reads frames from the MLX90640 camera (each frame is a 32×24 matrix).</li>
          <li>Identifies hotspots by thresholding pixels above ~28°C.</li>
          <li>Groups hot pixels into “blobs” and selects the blob with the highest average temperature.</li>
          <li>Determines how far this blob’s centroid is from the center of the frame.</li>
          <li>Sends signals to the Bescor MP-101 (via GPIO pins) to rotate in the correct direction.</li>
          <li>Maintains a target lock until a hotter spot appears, at which point it re-centers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We fine-tuned constants like dead zones, proportional gains, and blob-size thresholds
          through trial and error. The code can be seen 
          <a href="../projects/code-for-automatic-fan.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Assembly Challenges &amp; Solutions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Mounting the Fan:</strong> Drilling was required to attach the fan securely to the tripod head.
            We ensured the final combined weight stayed under the pan-tilt’s 10 lb limit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wiring &amp; Power:</strong> The biggest challenge was consolidating everything into one battery
            without messing up voltage requirements. A buck converter and careful splicing solved this.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Software Calibration:</strong> The IR camera’s resolution is only 32×24 pixels, so noise and small
            changes can throw it off. Iterative testing let us refine thresholds for minimum/maximum blob size.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Overall, the build required mechanical adaptation, electrical wiring expertise, and
          software calibration to achieve a cohesive, automated cooling solution. 
        </p>

      <!-- Testing & Results Section -->
      <section id="testing">
        <h2>Testing &amp; Results</h2>
        <p>
          We conducted multiple tests to validate performance. Water-resistance tests ensured
          the protective enclosure kept the Pi and wiring safe under light splashing (mimicking
          an IP3–IP4 style test). For functional checks, we verified the fan could rotate a full ~180°,
          detecting and following a human walking across the camera’s field of view. At lower speeds,
          the fan remained under ~50 dB, meeting our noise requirement. Finally, the fan’s total
          weight is around 8–9 lbs, so it’s easy to set up in less than a few minutes.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          I learned many things from doing this project. The first key lesson was taking an idea
          from simple brainstorming all the way to a fully realized concept—a process that was both
          exciting and challenging. I also gained hands-on experience in programming and soldering,
          which helped me better understand how hardware and software come together in a real-world
          application. Finally, I discovered how to modify existing products so they work more
          effectively for my specific goals.
