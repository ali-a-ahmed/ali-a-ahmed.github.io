        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Automatic Fan project (sometimes referred to as the “Hotspot Tracking Fan”) addresses the inefficiency
          of traditional fans that blow air indiscriminately. By detecting hotspots with a thermal camera and rotating
          automatically to aim cool air exactly where it’s needed, the system reduces wasted energy and offers targeted comfort.

        <h2>Design &amp; Components</h2>
        <p>
          This solution was built around four main components: the fan assembly, a motorized
          pan-tilt system, the MLX90640 thermal camera, and a Raspberry Pi. The fan assembly
          is lightweight and powered by an 18V battery for portability. The Bescor MP-101
          motorized tripod head provides the pan/tilt control. The MLX90640 IR camera detects
          heat gradients in a 32×24 pixel array. Finally, the Raspberry Pi processes sensor data
          and controls the motorized mount, ensuring the fan points at the hottest region in view.

        <h2>Build</h2>
        <p>
          The core of this project is the integration of the fan, motorized tripod, thermal camera, and
          power supply. Below is a more in-depth look at how each subsystem was assembled and
          how the software ties it all together.
        </p>

        <h3>Subsystem Assembly</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Fan Assembly:</strong><br>
          We began with an 18V portable fan—originally a Ryobi or similar brand—chosen for its
          cordless design. Several non-essential parts (like the base and certain covers) were removed
          to reduce weight. This reduced the overall load on the pan-tilt system, ensuring smooth
          and reliable rotation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pan-Tilt System Setup:</strong><br>
          A Bescor MP-101 motorized tripod head provides horizontal (pan) and vertical (tilt)
          rotation. Normally controlled via a simple wired remote, it was modified so the Raspberry
          Pi’s GPIO pins could drive the same signals. Each directional control wire (up, down, left,
          right) is routed to a corresponding GPIO pin, and additional support for power/ground ensures
          the head can still run off its own small battery pack or integrated power solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Thermal Camera Integration:</strong><br>
          The MLX90640 IR camera is mounted at the fan’s center axis. This camera connects to
          the Pi via the I2C bus (using SCL and SDA pins). We used a refresh rate of about 2 Hz,
          balancing performance with the Pi’s available processing resources. The camera captures
          a 32×24 temperature grid, which the Pi software interprets to pinpoint the location of
          the highest-temperature “blob” in view.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Power Supply Setup:</strong><br>
          We wanted everything powered from a single 18V battery, but the Pi requires 5V. Consequently,
          a step-down (buck) converter was introduced to regulate from 18V down to 5V/3A. The
          fan itself runs directly off 18V, while the Pi harnesses the stepped-down supply. A 3D-printed
          enclosure was created to protect the Pi, the step-down module, and associated wiring from
          water splashes or accidental damage.
        </p>

        <h3>Software Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          We wrote a Python script on the Raspberry Pi that:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Continuously reads frames from the MLX90640 camera (each frame is a 32×24 matrix).</li>
          <li>Identifies hotspots by thresholding pixels above a certain temperature (e.g. ~28°C).</li>
          <li>Groups hot pixels into “blobs” and selects the blob with the highest average temperature.</li>
          <li>Determines how far this blob’s centroid is from the center of the frame.</li>
          <li>Sends signals to the Bescor MP-101 (via GPIO pins) to rotate left/right/up/down until the
              blob is centered.</li>
          <li>Maintains a target lock until a hotter spot appears, at which point it re-centers on the
              new, higher-temperature blob.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We fine-tuned constants like dead zones, proportional gains, and blob-size thresholds
          through trial and error. For instance, if the movement was too jittery, we lowered the
          proportional gain. If it failed to detect a person standing at a distance, we adjusted the
          minimum blob area threshold.
        </p>

        <h3>Assembly Challenges &amp; Solutions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Mounting the Fan:</strong> Drilling was required to attach the fan securely to the tripod head.
            We ensured the final combined weight (fan + bracket + Pi enclosure) stayed under the
            pan-tilt’s maximum load limit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wiring &amp; Power:</strong> The biggest challenge was consolidating everything into one battery
            without messing up voltage requirements. A buck converter and careful splicing solved this.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Software Calibration:</strong> The IR camera’s resolution is only 32×24 pixels, so noise and small
            changes can throw it off. Iterative testing let us refine the thresholds for minimum blob
            size (so it ignores random hot spots like a coffee cup) and maximum blob size (so it
            doesn’t misread large backgrounds).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Overall, the build required mechanical adaptation, electrical wiring expertise, and
          software calibration to achieve a cohesive, automated cooling solution. 
        </p>

      <!-- Testing & Results Section -->
      <section id="testing">
        <h2>Testing &amp; Results</h2>
        <p>
          We conducted multiple tests to validate performance. Water-resistance tests ensured
          the protective enclosure kept the Pi and wiring safe under light splashing (mimicking
          an IP3–IP4 style test). For functional checks, we verified the fan could rotate a full ~180°,
          detecting and following a human walking across the camera’s field of view. At lower speeds,
          the fan remained under ~50 dB, meeting our noise requirement. Finally, the fan’s total
          weight is around 8–9 lbs, so it’s easy to set up in less than a few minutes.
        </p>

      <!-- User Manual / Basic Instructions -->
      <section id="manual">
        <h2>User Manual</h2>
        <h3>Powering On &amp; Setup</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Insert Battery:</strong> Attach the charged 18V battery to the fan’s power connector.</li>
          <li><strong>Flip the Switch:</strong> Turn on the fan’s main power knob. The Pi boots up automatically.</li>
          <li><strong>Wait for Initialization:</strong> The camera will start capturing thermal data within a few seconds.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Operating Modes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Automatic Mode:</em> The Raspberry Pi and IR camera run continuously, searching for new hotspots
          and aiming the fan in their direction.</li>
          <li><em>Manual Mode:</em> Swap out the Pi-control cable for the original remote cable to steer the fan
          wherever you please.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Maintenance &amp; Safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Clean the camera lens gently with a microfiber cloth to avoid dust build-up.</li>
          <li>Keep water away from the fan’s front or main motor, even though the electronics box
              is somewhat splash-resistant.</li>
          <li>When not in use, turn off the fan to conserve battery power.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          With minimal upkeep, the Automatic Fan should provide consistent, energy-efficient cooling
          for any environment that needs directed airflow.
