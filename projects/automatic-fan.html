        <p>
          The Automatic Fan project addresses the inefficiency
          of traditional fans that blow air indiscriminately. By detecting hotspots with a thermal camera and rotating
          automatically to aim cool air exactly where it’s needed, the system reduces wasted energy and offers targeted comfort.

            I worked on this project with a team of other engineering students. I was responsible for the brainstormming,
            the material procurements, modding the pan-tilt system and programming the different elements together. 
            The project took a year to complete and the budget was $500.00 USD.
            At the end, we were able to sucessfully demostrate that the fan was able to meet the requirements

        <h2>Design &amp; Components</h2>
        <p>
          This solution was built around four main components: the fan, a motorized
          pan-tilt system, the MLX90640 thermal camera, and a Raspberry Pi. The fan
          used is the Hybrid Whispher. We used it because it is lightweight and powered by an 18V battery for portability. The Bescor MP-101
          motorized tripod head provides the pan/tilt control. The MLX90640 IR camera detects
          heat gradients in a 32×24 pixel array and is compatiable with a Raspberry PI 4. 
          Finally, the Raspberry Pi 4 processes data
          and controls the motorized mount, ensuring the fan points at the hottest region in view.

        <h2>Build</h2>
        <p>
          The core of this project is the integration of the fan, motorized tripod, thermal camera, and
          power supply. Below is a more in-depth look at how each subsystem was assembled and
          how the software ties it all together.
        </p>

        <h3>Subsystem Assembly</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Fan Assembly:</strong><br>
          
          <img src="../images/Fan.PNG" alt="ONE+ 18V Cordless Hybrid WHISPER SERIES " width="500">

          We began with an 18V portable fan chosen for its
          cordless design. Several non-essential parts (like the base and certain covers) were removed
          to reduce weight. This reduced the overall load on the pan-tilt system.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pan-Tilt System Setup:</strong><br>

          <img src="../images/Tripod Cord Pic.PNG" alt="Tripod Cord Pic" width="500">
          <img src="../images/Tripod Head.PNG" alt="Tripod Head" width="500">

          A Bescor MP-101 motorized tripod head provides horizontal (pan) and vertical (tilt)
          rotation. Normally controlled via a simple wired remote, it was modified so the Raspberry
          Pi’s GPIO pins could drive the same signals. Each directional control wire (up, down, left,
          right) is routed to a corresponding GPIO pin, and additional support for power/ground ensures
          the head can still run off its own small battery pack or integrated power solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Thermal Camera Integration:</strong><br>

          <img src="../images/Thermal Camera attached.PNG" alt="Thermal Camera attached to the fan" width="500">
          The MLX90640 IR camera is attached at the center of the fan using a 3D case. This camera connects to
          the Raspberry Pi via using SCL and SDA pins. We used a refresh rate of about 2 Hz,
          balancing performance with the Pi’s available processing resources. The camera captures
          a 32×24 temperature grid, which the Pi software interprets to pinpoint the location of
          the highest-temperature “blob” in view.

          <img src="../images/Thermal Camera Images.PNG" alt="Thermal Camera Images" width="500">

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Power Supply Setup:</strong><br>
          <img src="../images/Power Supply.PNG" alt="Power Supply Setup" width="500">

          We wanted everything powered from a single 18V battery, but the Pi requires 5V.
          A step-down (buck) converter was introduced to regulate from 18V down to 5V/3A. The
          fan itself runs directly off 18V, while the Pi harnesses the stepped-down supply. A 3D-printed
          enclosure was created to protect the Pi, the step-down module, and associated wiring from
          water splashes or accidental damage.
        </p>

        <h3>Software Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          We wrote a Python script on the Raspberry Pi that:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Continuously reads frames from the MLX90640 camera (each frame is a 32×24 matrix).</li>
          <li>Identifies hotspots by thresholding pixels above a certain temperature (e.g. ~28°C).</li>
          <li>Groups hot pixels into “blobs” and selects the blob with the highest average temperature.</li>
          <li>Determines how far this blob’s centroid is from the center of the frame.</li>
          <li>Sends signals to the Bescor MP-101 (via GPIO pins) to rotate left/right/up/down until the
              blob is centered.</li>
          <li>Maintains a target lock until a hotter spot appears, at which point it re-centers on the
              new, higher-temperature blob.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We fine-tuned constants like dead zones, proportional gains, and blob-size thresholds
          through trial and error. The code can be seen  <a href="../projects/code-for-automatic-fan.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Assembly Challenges &amp; Solutions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Mounting the Fan:</strong> Drilling was required to attach the fan securely to the tripod head.
            We ensured the final combined weight (fan + bracket + Pi enclosure) stayed under the
            pan-tilt’s maximum load limit (10 lbs).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wiring &amp; Power:</strong> The biggest challenge was consolidating everything into one battery
            without messing up voltage requirements. A buck converter and careful splicing solved this.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Software Calibration:</strong> The IR camera’s resolution is only 32×24 pixels, so noise and small
            changes can throw it off. Iterative testing let us refine the thresholds for minimum blob
            size (so it ignores random hot spots like a coffee cup) and maximum blob size (so it
            doesn’t misread large backgrounds).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Overall, the build required mechanical adaptation, electrical wiring expertise, and
          software calibration to achieve a cohesive, automated cooling solution. 
        </p>

      <!-- Testing & Results Section -->
      <section id="testing">
        <h2>Testing &amp; Results</h2>
        <p>
          We conducted multiple tests to validate performance. Water-resistance tests ensured
          the protective enclosure kept the Pi and wiring safe under light splashing (mimicking
          an IP3–IP4 style test). For functional checks, we verified the fan could rotate a full ~180°,
          detecting and following a human walking across the camera’s field of view. At lower speeds,
          the fan remained under ~50 dB, meeting our noise requirement. Finally, the fan’s total
          weight is around 8–9 lbs, so it’s easy to set up in less than a few minutes.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          I learned many things from doing this project. The first key lesson was taking an idea
          from simple brainstorming all the way to a fully realized concept—a process that was both
          exciting and challenging. I also gained hands-on experience in programming and soldering,
          which helped me better understand how hardware and software come together in a real-world
          application. Finally, I discovered how to modify existing products so they work more
          effectively for my specific goals.
